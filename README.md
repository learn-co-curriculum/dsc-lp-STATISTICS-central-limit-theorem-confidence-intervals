#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson covers the central limit theorem and calculating confidence intervals using the T-distribution. The initial portion investigates the central limit theorem through a simulation which should set the foundation for a discussion with students. From there, confidence intervals are demonstrated by example and students are asked to repeat and then extend the same process, calculating a confidence interval using SciPy for a given sample and then extending that knowledge to repeat this process and visualize the results.

#### Topic:

Statistics: The Central Limit Theorem and Confidence Intervals 


#### Prerequisite knowledge:

Students should have a solid understanding of probability before tackling this lesson including the normal distribution, z-scores and associated p-values using the scipy package.

#### Learning goals for this lesson:


* Students can explain the concept of confidence intervals
* Students can calculate confidence intervals for a sample parameter using scipy.


#### Misconceptions / Notes

* The central limit theorem has broader implications and applications then described here. This is worth pointing out to students. That said, due to limited time, focusing on the narrower scope outlined here is still recommended.
